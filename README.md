# 💡 CreditSense Examples

This repository provides a collection of high-level usage examples to help developers understand how to work with the CreditSense platform. It acts as an entry point for exploring common integration patterns and demonstrating how CreditSense API requests are typically structured and executed in practice.

The goal of this repository is not to serve as full documentation, but to offer practical, lightweight, and adaptable examples that illustrate real-world usage in a clear and approachable way.

## 🧠 Overview

The examples included here are intentionally minimal, focusing on core concepts rather than implementation details. They highlight common behaviors seen across CreditSense integrations and are designed to be portable across different languages, tools, and architectures.

These examples provide a foundation for developers who want to experiment, learn the request flow, and extend the patterns into their own environments. More detailed or tool-specific guidance may be found within individual example directories—for instance, the Postman folder contains its own dedicated README.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the examples:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the example directories you are interested in.
3. Follow the instructions provided within those directories (e.g., the Postman folder’s README).
4. Configure any required environment variables—such as API keys, endpoints, or tokens—based on your CreditSense integration setup.
5. Experiment with the examples to become familiar with typical CreditSense request and response flows.

## 🌟 Purpose of These Examples

These examples aim to:

- Provide clear, adaptable demonstrations for interacting with CreditSense APIs  
- Help new developers quickly get oriented without needing a full application  
- Encourage experimentation and exploration through hands-on usage samples  
- Offer contextual guidance that complements the official CreditSense documentation  

Each example is meant to serve as a small, understandable building block that you can use as-is or extend as part of your integration process.
