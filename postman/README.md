# CreditSense Postman Collections

This directory contains Postman collections and environment configurations intended to support evaluation and inspection of example GraphQL operations available within the CreditSense platform. The materials provided here are supplementary in nature and are not designed to serve as authoritative documentation for the API or its associated workflows.

The content is aligned with the example scenarios and reference patterns described in the official CreditSense developer documentation. Users should consult the primary documentation for comprehensive guidance on resolver behavior, workflow composition, authentication models, and integration best practices:

These Postman assets are provided strictly as a convenience for teams requiring a structured format for reviewing example operations within Postman. They do not encompass the full set of platform capabilities and should not be considered exhaustive or definitive.
